### Tunnll to provide software technology for dynamic bus scheduling optimization; Björks&Byberg to provide vehicles and drivers; Malmö University to research urban development outcomes; the City of Härnösand to support the new type of mobility service in the city; Vinnova to provide co-financing to the project.


Tunnll (startup company), Björks&Byberg (transport operator), Malmö University (K2) and the City of Härnösand are partnering to develop a pilot project that will allow the transport operator to optimize the movement of buses and serve more passengers with the same vehicles and drivers.

Co-financed through Vinnova’s Drive Sweden program, the pilot project aims to test the feasibility of the new technology. The project is planned to run for 24 months. Through the project duration the partners aim to validate the efficiency gains for the public bus transportation network and to research the mobility-related outcomes for the passengers.
